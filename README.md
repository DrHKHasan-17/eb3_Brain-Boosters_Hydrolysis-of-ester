<b> Experiment|     <b> Determination of rate constant of hydrolysis of esters.

<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

To determine the rate constant for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of ethyle acetate.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

Ethyle acetate undergoes hydrolysis, in presence of an acid, to give acetic acid and ethyle alcohol. This experiment is performed by the titration process. The rate of reaction is determined by one concentration term only.
