## Theory 
<b>PRINCIPLE: </b><br>
The hydrolysis of an ester occurs according to the equation <br>
<b>CH<sub>3</sub>COOC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O <span>&#8594;</span> CH<sub>3</sub>COOH + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH </b><br>
This reaction follows pseudo first order kinetics. <br>
<b>CALCULATION:</b><br>
The rate constant K is determined using the equation,<br>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;K=(2.303/t)(log((V0-V∞)/(Vt-V∞)))</b><br>
Rate constant is also determined graphically by plotting Vs time.
