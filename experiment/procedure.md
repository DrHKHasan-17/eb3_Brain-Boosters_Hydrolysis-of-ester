## Procedure 
1. 100 ml of 0.1 N HCl is taken in a clean dry conical flask.
2. 5 ml of ester is pipetted out into the conical flask and the mixture is immediately withdrawn into another dry conical flask.
3. A stop watch is started simultaneously (A time stamp is shown in simulator).
4. The reaction is then arrested by the addition of ice cubes and the mixture is titrated against 0.2 N NaOH using phenolphthalein as indicator.
5. End point is the appearance of permanent pink colour.
6.The volume of NaOH consumed in this titration is taken as V0.
7. 5 ml of acid – ester mixture is similarly withdrawn after 10, 20, 30, 40 minutes respectively and titrated against NaOH using phenolphthalein as indicator.
8. The volume of NaOH consumed for each of the above time intervals (t), is taken as Vt.
9. The contents are transferred into boiling tube with a cap and heated in a water bath forabout 60 minutes.
10. 5 ml of this mixture is withdrawn and titrated against NaOH to get V∞.
